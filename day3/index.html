    <b><p>Congratulations on Qualifying.<br>Achievments of Indian Space and Research Organisation cannot be summed up in few words .
        Through it's successful missions such as Mangalyaan  and Chandrayaan-3, ISRO has shown its capability to explore space with minimal resourses and budget.
        It has become an inspiration for both India and the world.<br>
        The fundamental components for each mission vary from both simple to complex technologies and system  designs. <br>

        <p><u>Logic gates</u> are fundamental components in the design of control systems and processors used in rockets, satellites, and space exploration. They play a crucial role in managing and processing data, ensuring the proper functioning of various systems onboard.</p>

        <p><u>Encryption and decryption</u> are employed in communication systems to secure sensitive information transmitted between spacecraft, ground stations, and other components. This helps prevent unauthorized access or tampering, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the data.</p>
        
        <p>In summary, logic gates are used for processing and control, while encryption and decryption play a key role in securing communication systems within space exploration technologies.<br>
    Get ready to delve into the world of Logic gates and cryptography to decipher your victory.<br></p>
    It's Time to get cracking.</b>
